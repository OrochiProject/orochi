implementation notes

autoincrement:
    select max id from
    read from files
    currect hack is manual count max, implicit assumption is that id is only set by system not by user

[FIXED] escape characters:
    
insert on duplicate update:

[DONE] primary_key unique_key 

[DONE] check db access log type and ret val

[DONE] for commit and rollback, take ts first then execute

[FIXED] for update_table timestamp, the init phase is not counted!

[FIXED] does table name has ``???????
